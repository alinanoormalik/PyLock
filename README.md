# NetCrypt
Welcome to **NetCrypt**! This is a collection of Python-based projects focused on **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **cryptography**.
The goal here is to build tools that help demonstrate core security concepts in a practical way, and also serve as educational resources for anyone interested in learning about these topics.

## What’s Inside?
### Cryptography
- **Caesar Cipher** – A basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number.
- **Vigenère Cipher** – A more advanced cipher using a keyword to encrypt the message.

### Networking & Security (Coming Soon)
- Tools like port scanners, packet sniffers, and symmetric encryption methods like AES and Fernet.
- Utilities for password management, hashing, and basic network monitoring.

## What’s Coming Next?
There’s a lot more to come in **NetCrypt**. Here are just a couple of things I’m currently working on:

### **Networking Project: Packet Sniffer**
A packet sniffer that will allow you to capture and analyze network traffic. 
This is a great way to understand how data moves through networks and can help in detecting potential security risks.
### **Cybersecurity Project: Password Manager**
A secure password manager to safely store and encrypt your credentials.
It will generate strong passwords and keep them safe,all built with Python’s cryptography libraries to ensure your data stays protected.
