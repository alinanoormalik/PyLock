# PyLock
Welcome to **PyLock**! ðŸŽ‰ A collection of cryptographic tools and a password manager, all built with Python. Iâ€™ll keep adding more projects in the future, so stay tuned!

## Project Structure

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
### Algorithms
1. **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number.
2. **VigenÃ¨re Cipher**: A stronger encryption technique that uses a keyword to shift letters. 

### Password Manager
1. **Passkeep**: A simple yet effective password manager that allows you to store, retrieve, and delete your passwords securely. It uses a basic text file to store the credentials.
2. **Passshield**: A password strength checker that helps you assess the security of your password and gives feedback based on its strength.
